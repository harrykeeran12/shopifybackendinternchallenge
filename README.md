# Shopify Backend Internship Challenge

This is a repository for the Shopify Backend Internship Challenge.

I created this through using a combination of MongoDB, Node and Express, as well as vanilla JavaScript.

To run the server, either use the `script.sh` file, by cloning the git repository, then running ` chmod +x script.sh && ./script.sh ` or run `cd backend && npm install && node .`.

It can be accessed on repl.it [here](https://shopifybackendinternchallenge.harrykeeran12.repl.co/).
