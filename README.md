# Shopify Backend Internship Challenge

This is a repository for the Shopify Backend Internship Challenge.

I created this through using a combination of MongoDB, Node and Express, as well as vanilla JavaScript.

To run this,`cd` into the cloned directory first, then start the server using `node backend/index.js`.

Then run the [index.html]('https://github.com/harrykeeran12/shopifybackendinternchallenge/blob/master/frontend/index.html') file in the frontend.
